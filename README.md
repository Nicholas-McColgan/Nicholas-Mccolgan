# Nicholas McColgan

Hi my name is Nicholas, I recently graduated with an integrated masterâ€™s degree in Engineering (MEng) from the University of Oxford, specialising in Machine Learning. During my studies, I had the privilege of working alongside the Oxford-Man Institute of Quantitative Finance, where I collaborated with Jan-Peter Calliess and Fabian Krause on my Masterâ€™s thesis. The focus of the thesis was to improve the uncertainty quantification and interpretability of neural network decision-making using a novel probabilistic logic augmentation framework, and applying it on financial time series data to enhance portfolio optimisation, risk management, and market trend indentification.
